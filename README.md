# MLP-binary-classification

## Project Overview

This repository contains the completed project.  
The goal was to build a binary classifier using a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) neural network on the provided dataset, following the requirements described in `Project_Requrments.pdf`[attached_file:2].

- **Inputs:** X1, X2, X3, X4, X5
- **Target:** Y (classes 0 and 1)
- **Problem:** Predict Y using input features with high accuracy.
