## Project Summary

- Built an MLP neural network using TensorFlow/Keras.
- Data split: 80% training, 20% testing.
- Accuracy reached: ~98.97%.
- Overfitting/underfitting analyzed; fixed with additional layers, early stopping.
- All steps well-commented and explained in notebook[attached_file:1].
- Performance metrics and loss/accuracy plots included.
